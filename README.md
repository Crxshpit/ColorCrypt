## Overview

ColorCrypt is a personal project and original idea of mine, with the purpose of taking a given string (no longer than aprox. 1000 characters long for resolution sake) and encrypting it into an image, *pixel* by *pixel*, with the use of binary. Any image generated through this program can also be decrypted using the decoder module included. Please bear in mind **only images generated through this program** can be decrypted within the decoder module. 

**Disclaimer**: This scripts way of encryption is by no means secure, and was made with no intent of being used as a commercial or as a method of sensitive data encryption, but rather as a concept and a fun way to send secret messages between friends. The current method of string encoding is inadequate for any transfer of sensitive information in the regard of security as the safety of your encoded text cannot be guaranteed, and highly advised to be cautious of the information you encode. With a bit of brain power, it's definately possible for an image to be decoded without the use of the decoding module.
